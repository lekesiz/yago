## ⚠️ PARTIAL FEATURES (70%)

### 1. Task Assignment Engine ⚠️
**Status:** 70% COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Basic task creation for base agents
- ✅ Task assignment to Planner, Coder, Tester, Reviewer, Documenter

**Missing (from prompts):**
- ⚠️ Advanced TaskAssignmentEngine class
- ⚠️ Dynamic task routing to specialized agents
- ⚠️ Execution strategy selection (sequential/parallel/race)
- ⚠️ Dependency graph management

**Impact:** Medium
- System works but tasks always go to base agents
- Dynamic agents created but not fully utilized in task flow

**Recommendation:** Implement in v7.1

---

### 2. Advanced Conflict Resolution ⚠️
**Status:** 60% COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Basic ConflictResolver
- ✅ 3 resolution strategies (auto_fix, reassign, escalate)

**Missing (from prompts):**
- ⚠️ API mismatch auto-correction
- ⚠️ Style conflict auto-formatting
- ⚠️ Implementation scoring algorithm
- ⚠️ Agent notification system

**Impact:** Low
- Basic conflict detection works
- More sophisticated resolution would be nice-to-have

**Recommendation:** Implement in v7.1

---

## ❌ MISSING FEATURES (0%)

### 1. Real-Time Event-Driven Monitoring ❌
**Status:** 0% (Planned for v7.1)

**From Prompts (Etap 3.3):**
```python
class SuperAdminOrchestrator:
    async def supervise(self):
        while True:
            event = await self.event_queue.get()
            await self.handle_event(event)
```

**Current Behavior:**
- Super Admin runs AFTER execution
- Post-mortem analysis only

**Desired Behavior:**
- Real-time monitoring DURING execution
- Event queue for task completions
- Live intervention

**Impact:** Medium
- System works but supervision is not real-time
- No live intervention possible

**Recommendation:** v7.1 priority feature

---

### 2. Advanced Execution Engine ❌
**Status:** 0% (Planned for v7.1)

**From Prompts (Etap 2.2):**
```python
class ExecutionEngine:
    async def execute_sequential()
    async def execute_parallel()
    async def execute_race()
```

**Current Behavior:**
- Uses default CrewAI execution (sequential)

**Desired Behavior:**
- Intelligent execution strategy
- Parallel execution for independent tasks
- Race mode for cost optimization

**Impact:** Medium
- System works but not optimized for speed

**Recommendation:** v7.1 feature

---

### 3. Dynamic Agent Custom Tools ❌
**Status:** 0% (Planned for v7.1)

**Current Behavior:**
- Dynamic agents created but use no tools

**Desired Behavior:**
- SecurityAgent → security_scanner, secret_detector
- DevOpsAgent → docker_builder, k8s_deployer
- etc.

**Impact:** Low
- Agents work with LLM knowledge alone
- Tools would enhance capabilities

**Recommendation:** v7.1 enhancement

```

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

### Priority 3: Execution Strategies
```python
# Implement parallel/race modes
class ExecutionEngine:
    async def execute_parallel(self):

        # 2-3x speedup
```

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

### Priority 4: Agent Tools
