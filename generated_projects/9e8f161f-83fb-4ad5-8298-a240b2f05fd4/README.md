# REST API for Task Management

This project is a REST API designed for task management applications. It is built with Python, using the FastAPI framework, and PostgreSQL as the database. SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interactions, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. Database migrations are managed by Alembic.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality using JWT for authentication.
- **Task Management:** Allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Assignment:** Users can assign tasks to other registered users.
- **Deadline Tracking:** Each task includes a deadline field, enabling users to track due dates.
- **Category Organization:** Tasks can be categorized for better organization.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.8 or newer)
- PostgreSQL
- pip

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/task-management-api.git
cd task-management-api
```

2. **Virtual Environment**

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Database Setup**

Ensure PostgreSQL is running. Create a database for the project:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE task_management;
```

5. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/task_management
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt
```

6. **Database Migration**

Run Alembic migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

7. **Run the Application**

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
