# Test Project

## Description
Test Project is a modern, full-stack web application designed to showcase best practices in developing and deploying scalable, high-performance web applications. Leveraging a powerful combination of Node.js and Express.js on the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage, the project offers a robust foundation for building sophisticated web applications. Enhanced security is provided through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, while AWS serves as the cloud provider, ensuring high availability and scalability. Elasticsearch facilitates advanced search capabilities, Redis is used for caching to improve performance, RabbitMQ for handling message queues efficiently, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration, making deployment and scaling seamless.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionalities using JWT.
- **Data Storage:** MongoDB integration for storing and retrieving data.
- **Advanced Search:** Elasticsearch implementation for powerful search capabilities.
- **High Performance:** Redis caching to enhance application performance.
- **Message Queuing:** RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing.
- **Scalability:** Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, respectively, ensuring the application scales efficiently on AWS.

## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- An AWS account
- Elasticsearch, Redis, and RabbitMQ installations or cloud service accounts.

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/testproject.git
   cd testproject
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and update the variables with your specific configurations for MongoDB, AWS, JWT secret, etc.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Running the application:**
   - Locally:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - Using Docker:
     ```
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - Deploy on Kubernetes (assuming you have kubectl configured):
     ```
     kubectl apply -f k8s/
     ```

## Usage Examples
- **User Signup:**
  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/signup -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"user1", "password":"password"}'
  ```
- **User Login:**
  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"user1", "password":"password"}'
  ```
