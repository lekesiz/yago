## 🎓 Design Philosophy

### Old Thinking (v6.0):
```
"Let's limit resources to control costs"
→ Incomplete requirements
→ Generic solutions
→ Multiple rework cycles
→ Higher total cost
→ Technical debt
```

### New Thinking (v7.0):
```
"Invest in complete requirements upfront"
→ Comprehensive clarification
→ Specialized agents for each domain
→ Production-ready first delivery
→ Zero rework
→ Lower total cost
→ No technical debt
```

### Core Principles:
1. **Quality > Cost** - Invest upfront to avoid rework
2. **Specialization > Generalization** - Right tool for each job
3. **Clarity > Speed** - Understand before building
4. **Automation > Manual** - Let AI handle complexity
5. **Real-time > Batch** - Monitor and intervene live
