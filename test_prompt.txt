Build a lightweight REST API for task management with the following features:

Core Functionality:
- User authentication with JWT
- CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- Task categorization and priority levels
- Due date tracking and reminders

Technical Requirements:
- Python FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching
- Docker containerization
- Pytest for testing
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger

Quality Standards:
- 80% test coverage minimum
- Security best practices (input validation, SQL injection prevention)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Proper error handling and logging

Deployment:
- Docker Compose for local development
- Production-ready Dockerfile
- Environment variable configuration
- Health check endpoints

This is a medium-complexity project that should trigger:
- ClarificationAgent (20-30 questions)
- Dynamic agent creation (SecurityAgent, DevOpsAgent, DatabaseAgent, APIDesignAgent)
- Hybrid execution strategy
- Real-time supervision
